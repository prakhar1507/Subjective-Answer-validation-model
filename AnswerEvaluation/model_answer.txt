The Water Cycle, also known as the Hydrological Cycle, is a continuous process by which water moves through the environment, maintaining the balance of nature. It involves various stages, including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and collection.

Evaporation occurs when the sun heats up water bodies like oceans, rivers, and lakes, turning the water into vapor. This water vapor rises and cools down to form clouds in the process called condensation.

When the clouds become heavy, the water falls back to the Earth as precipitation in the form of rain, snow, or hail. Some of this water infiltrates the ground and replenishes groundwater, while the rest flows back into water bodies, completing the cycle.

This cycle plays a crucial role in distributing fresh water across the planet, supporting plant and animal life, and regulating weather patterns. Without the Water Cycle, life on Earth would not be sustainable.

Examples of the Water Cycle in daily life include rainfall that nourishes crops, evaporation from wet clothes when drying, and the formation of dew on grass early in the morning. [10]
