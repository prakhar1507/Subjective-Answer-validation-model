The Water Cycle is the movement of water around the earth. It includes many steps like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Water gets heated by the sun and turns into vapor which forms clouds. Later it rains, and water comes back to rivers and oceans.

It also includes infiltration where water goes into the soil and becomes groundwater. This process helps plants to grow and animals to survive. Without this cycle, there would be no rainfall and all living beings would suffer.

In daily life, we can see the water cycle when wet clothes dry due to evaporation or when dew forms on grass in the morning. [10]
