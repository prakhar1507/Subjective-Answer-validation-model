Water Cycle is the process by which water keeps moving in the environment. The main steps are evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.

When the sun heats the water, it turns into vapor (evaporation). The vapor cools down to form clouds (condensation). Later, water falls down as rain or snow (precipitation). This cycle helps to maintain the balance of water on Earth and gives fresh water to plants, animals, and humans.

Without the Water Cycle, life would not be possible. We see it when clothes dry or when rain fills lakes and ponds. [10]
