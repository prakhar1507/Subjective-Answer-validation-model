Water Cycle is a natural process in which water moves from land to sky and comes back again. It has different stages like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.

Evaporation happens when sun heats water bodies and turns them into vapor. Then it forms clouds through condensation. Later, the water falls as rain or snow. Some water also goes underground which is called infiltration.

Water Cycle is very important because it helps in irrigation, weather regulation, and supports life on Earth. Without it, survival of plants, animals, and humans would be impossible. [10]
