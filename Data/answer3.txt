The Water Cycle, also known as the Hydrological Cycle, is a natural and continuous process through which water circulates in the Earth's environment. It consists of various important stages like Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation, Infiltration, and Collection.

Evaporation occurs when the Sun heats water bodies such as oceans, lakes, and rivers, turning water into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere and cools down to form clouds in the process of Condensation.

Later, when clouds become heavy, water falls back to the Earth's surface as Precipitation  this can be in the form of rain, snow, or hail. Some of this water seeps underground through Infiltration and becomes groundwater, while the rest collects in water bodies like rivers and oceans, completing the cycle.

The Water Cycle plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of our planet. It helps in the distribution of fresh water, supports plant growth, animal survival, and regulates the Earth's climate and weather patterns.

Examples of the Water Cycle can be seen when wet clothes dry due to Evaporation, rainfall irrigating crops, and dew formation on grass during early morning hours. Without this cycle, life on Earth would not be sustainable. [10]
